# Satellite Image Classification in Romania using SAS Viya and the Amazon Dataset

This is the modified dataset that we created for our image classification problem. The dataset contains the training images from [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/data) on Kaggle, but the classes are now binary: deforestification, non_deforestification
